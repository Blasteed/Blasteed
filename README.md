- 👋 Hi, I’m Karfee
- 👀 I’m interested in programming language's culture, computer's history, esolangs, networking, cybersec and other boring stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Python, C#, LOLCODE, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and others... Anyway, you'll never see me studying
- 💞️ I’m NOT looking for collaboration, I'm into working alone... only if you're a nice (NICE!), I'll like you
- 📫 You can reach me by my e-mail, acarfagna03@gmail.com and on Discord at "𝒦𝒶𝓇𝒻𝑒𝑒#9813"
- 🈺 Manga and Animes lover (that's not important, maybe people will like/hate me)
- 📚 English language user. Someone said me that I'm a C1 level, so I'll understand you, fish and chips eater
