### Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate technician with a background in DevOps. I have extensive experience with Python 🐍 and also have knowledge of C/C++ and JavaScript. I enjoy working on web programming and creating innovative solutions.

When I'm not coding, I love watching anime 🎌 (Naruto 🍥 is my favorite!) and playing video games, especially Skyrim. 🎮
