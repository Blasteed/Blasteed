- 👋 Hi, I’m *Karfee*
- 👀 I’m interested in programming language's culture, computer's history, esolangs, networking, cybersec and other boring stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, CSS, JavaScript and others... Anyway, you'll never see me studying
- 💞️ I’m NOT looking for collaboration, I'm into working alone...

- 🈺 Manga and Animes lover
